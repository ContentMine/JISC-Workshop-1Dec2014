#Legal Implications of Content Mining

This session is led by Charles Oppenheim ([@CharlesOppenh](https://twitter.com/CharlesOppenh)) and explores the implications of copyright and database rights for content mining activities.

We will cover the relevant statutory laws, exemptions, case law and other information relevant for researchers wishing to embark on responsible and legal content mining projects.

#### UK law

#### Publisher's policies

- Springer's text and data mining [policy](http://www.springer.com/gp/rights-permissions/springer-s-text-and-data-mining-policy/29056) - an example of a well-thought through policy that tries and succeeds to support TDM research.
- Elsevier's text and data mining [policy] (http://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/content-mining-policies) - an example of a poorly thought through policy that creates artificial restrictions.
