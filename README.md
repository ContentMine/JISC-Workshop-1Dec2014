* Enabling Jisc staff to better understand how TDM affects the work of Jisc’s customers and the work of particular Jisc staff.
* Describing the legal framework in which TDM takes place.
* Allowing Jisc staff to discuss with experts any questions they might have.


####Organisers:

* Peter Murray-Rust

### Documentation

Notes will be taken and a report will be created and shared with Jisc staff following the workshop.

The primary means of communication and taking notes during the workshop will be via this [Etherpad] (http://pads.cottagelabs.com/p/contentmine_jisc2014). 

If you're not familiar with Etherpads, it's easy - you just type! Your writing will show up in a different colour to other people's and you can associate the colour with your name by clicking the person icon in the top right corner of the screen.
